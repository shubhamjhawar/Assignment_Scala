### Shikhar's Approach

#### Question-1:

- This is a function that takes a double value as input and returns a string that represents a range of values.
- The function first calculates the remainder of the input value when multiplied by 1000 to determine if the value needs to be rounded up or down to the nearest 0.05.
- Depending on the remainder value, the function calculates the left and right boundaries of the range and formats them as strings with 3 decimal places, concatenating them with a hyphen to create the range string.

#### Question-2:

##### Task-1:
Sorted the list in descending order based on the runs scored by the players using sortby function and then top player instance is taken by using the take function.

##### Task-2:
Sorted the list in descending order based on the runs scored by the players using sortby function and then the top 5 players' instances are taken by using the take function.

##### Task-3:
Sorted the list in descending order based on the wickets taken by the players using sortby function and then the top 5 players' instances are taken by using the take function.

##### Task-4:
Sorted the list in descending order based on the performance taken by the players using sortwith function and then the rank of players is printed by a user-defined function.
